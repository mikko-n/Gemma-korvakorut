================
Gemma neopixel earrings from Adafruit tutorial with a button to select programs and a switch to power the thing off.

Code is mostly thrown together so there's some unpolished & not-working-as-expected parts included. Your results may vary.

Fritzing schema & development idea for connecting parts together are included.

Build finally complete after several hardware failures, lost & refound motivation and almost whole calendar year.
